## Q&A
#### Q: will there be support for an X platform except windows?<br>
#### A: Im a single developer who does that as hobby. Unless i have more ppl in the team or contributors at least chances are slim. Moreover I have only 3 major platforms to test the stuff: PC(windows 10 64bit), web and android. Making android version is kinda redundant and web version will be always missing some features.<br>
---
#### Q: Can I contribute X feature to the program?<br>
#### A: Of cource you can. Steps for that:<br>
- Ask me on discord or open issue here on github.<br>
- After permission, download latest Godot engine (<a href="https://godotengine.org/download">3.4</a> as of right now) and fork this project.<br>
- After you finished adding the feature (you need at least test it :|) open pull request and wait till my approval or denial.<br>
---
#### Q: Ya have patreon linked in the program. Should we expect some features be patreon supporter only?<br>
#### A: Prob not. At maximum some cosmetics and nothing that in any way limits program functionality.<br>
