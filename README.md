# IMPORTANT
SWITCHED ENGINE. Well actually just ditched idea of making it on game engine. I actually tried to make it now on Electron. It is what most cool apps use, including such as Blockbench. So go to https://github.com/GibberishDev/Jigsaw once it ready. Expect:
* In-app theme editor
* Multi-window support(Not the tabs in one app but rather Pop-out windows)
* Support for minecraft textures and maybe from some popular mods(Or I would be omegamind by then and would be able to snag textures from .jar files of mods so user would just supply their _mods_ foulder to snag resources from it)
* Much more that i cant think of rn but would surely see it as nessecety in future. Yeah. Maybe mod compat if i will develop some system of marketplace and setup servers for it... Oh and limit ppl from just developing keyloggers and other nasty stuff.

# SARM

Nifty standalone program for mod pack developers. It is used for creating json text for recipes for popular mods.
previously SARM standed for Sequenced Asembly Recipe Maker but now when it includes more that Sequenced assembly I call it *Sureley Awesome Recipe Maker* (Yeah Yeah I know. Im a Genius)

## Q&A
#### Q: will there be support for an X platform except windows?<br>
#### A: Im a single developer who does that as hobby. Unless i have more ppl in the team or contributors at least chances are slim. Moreover I have only 3 major platforms to test the stuff: PC(windows 10 64bit), web and android. Making android version is kinda redundant and web version will be always missing some features.<br>
---
#### Q: Can I contribute X feature to the program?<br>
#### A: Of cource you can. Steps for that:<br>
- Ask me on discord or open issue here on github.<br>
- After permission, download latest Godot engine (<a href="https://godotengine.org/download">3.4.4</a> as of right now) and fork this project.<br>
- After you finished adding the feature (you need at least test it :|) open pull request and wait till my approval or denial.<br>
---
#### Q: Ya have patreon linked in the program. Should we expect some features be patreon supporter only?<br>
#### A: Prob not. At maximum some cosmetics and nothing that in any way limits program functionality.<br>
